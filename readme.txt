What' This:
-----------
This is an add-in (i.e. plug in) for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0. It does following of things:
1. Adds/removes line numbers from Visual Basic projects so that you can use Erl function to exactly locate where the error occurred. Unlike other add-ins, this one has been thoroughly tested on live complex projects for more then a year and has lots of code to workaround VB IDE object model bugs. It comes with source code, does numbering on whole project group and also does smart numbering (for example it won't number trivial assignment statements in Property Get).
2. With a click of a button, this add-in can also add error handlers in all methods. Again unlike other similar utilities, this one has been thoroughly tested, accepts a directive to turn off error handler and has some decision making code to decide whether an error handler would effect actual logic.
3. Fix for VB's recent menu item bug (MRU). You might have noticed VB's Recent project item menu always gets messed up. This add-in would fix them. You can see the screenshot in WizAddIn.jpg.
